# How to not cry while using SimCenter3D

**Prologue**

Anyone can be trained to perform FEA. Only capable engineers can use FEA to create high quality simulations _that adequately model the physics of the real world_ and produce accurate, useful results.

So how do you become a capable (structural) engineer? You start with the basics. Know your Statics, know your Mechanics of Materials. Notice I didnt say "Take ME 270". Classes will help you learn the material, but you can learn the material without classes, and you can certainly pass a class without learning the material.

One of the fastest ways to cover these topics is:&#x20;
