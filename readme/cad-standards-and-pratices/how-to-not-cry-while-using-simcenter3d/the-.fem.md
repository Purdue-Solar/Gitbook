  In this context, FEM stands for Finite Element Model. It can also refer to the
  Finite Element Method, which is the mathematical framework with Finite Element
  Analysis (FEA) runs on.

# The .fem

* Right click the fem in the simulation navigator > edit > useful menu
  * ALWAYS change polygon body resolution to high if not already
  * Can change geometry options here too&#x20;
    * Import points
* When creating, be conscious of whether you want an .i part or not.&#x20;
  * My advice: Make a .i until you feel comfortable enough not using it.
* Dont touch anything else unless you know what you are doing
* “Edit Display”
  * Very useful for all sorts of things. You want to be comfortable when doing analysis, and the display is part of that. It provides you information to do your job better.
*   Mesh Collectors

    * Typically you want elements with mid nodes
    * theres a setting somewhere to make the processor do non-linear element treatment, turn that on
    * 1D
      * Beam Cross sections
      * 2D
        * shell and plate elements
          * honestly just use shells i think. The difference is weird so google it.
      * 3D
    * cubes ("hex") or pyramids (tetrahedrons ("tets")
