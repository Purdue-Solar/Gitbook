## What do we need to make?

Brakes is a safety critical system whose main function is to transfer mechanical rotational energy to heat energy by use of brake calipers pressing brake pads into the brake rotor, slowing the car down.&#x20;

* For our car, the minimum deceleration requirement is 4.72 m/s^2, required by ASC. Additionally, the front and rear braking systems need to be separate and the rear brake needs to be capable of holding 15% of the cars mass.&#x20;
* Additionally, we are responsible for the parking brake. Here, the parking brake needs to hold 10% of the car's mass, but ideally we would like it to hold more like 40% of the car's mass so the car can be held on a hill without much issue



## Research Resources

Tune to Win - great resource for general car design, more for racing applications but the basics are applicable for any type of design really

The Winning Solar Car - great resource for solar car specific design, no need to do homework problems, or do them if you want to be a better engineer. The readings are great to reference however
