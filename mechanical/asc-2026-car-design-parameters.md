# ASC 2026 Car Design Parameters

## Regulation Changes for ASC 2026

From Adem, ASC staff, end of ASC 2024 awards ceremony:[https://www.youtube.com/live/n4c7g2wkM9c](https://www.youtube.com/live/n4c7g2wkM9c)

* Far past due date to release FSGP 2025 regs
* FSGP 2025 regs based on ASC 2026 regs
* Expect complete ASC 2026 regs release in early fall??
* Planning on matching WSC 6m^2 solar array size for ASC 2026
* Moving to sizing batteries based on data sheet capacitance (not weight)
* Reducing battery size somewhat, but not going all the way down to 3kWh
* WSC 2025 bounding box: 5.8 m long, 2.3 m wide, 1.65 m high
* FSGP 2025 bounding box: 5.0 m long, 2.2 m wide, 1.6 m high
