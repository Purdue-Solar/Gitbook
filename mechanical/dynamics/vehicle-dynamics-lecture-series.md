### Notes on Videos

**All videos:** At first, don't worry about the math or equations, just take notes on the key ideas and concepts being presented to familiarize yourself with the content

**Coilover Shock absorber | Coil spring designing | Damper calculations | Mounting points of coilover:** You can skip the sections from 9:04 - 14:00.

**Basic Solar Car Suspension Design:** This is a long video by Bill from ASC. I recommend breaking this into chunks. Around 59:00, he says that caster should equal or exceed KPI to have negative camber on the outside wheel -> this is incorrect for a few reasons, ignore what he claims here. I encourage you to set up a simple motion assembly in CAD to test how these two angles affect camber while turning the wheel. You'll find that for small KPI, caster, and steering angles, his claims are not true.
