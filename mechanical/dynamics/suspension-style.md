# Suspension Style

**Direct Chassis Shock Mount**

In commercial vehicles, shocks are often mounted directly to the chassis. This Simplifies design and reduces cost compared to push or pull rod systems. However, our wheels will be too far away from our chassis for this to work properly.

#### Push Rod vs. Pull Rod Suspension Systems

Push rod and pull rod suspension systems are methods used to connect the suspension components to a vehicle's chassis, each offering distinct benefits and drawbacks. Push rod systems are favorably simple and cost-effective, while pull rod systems enhance weight distribution and aerodynamics but at a higher complexity and cost.

**Push Rod:**

* Mounted from the upper part of the chassis to the lower wishbone
* Simpler design, easier access, and cheaper.
  * Reduces chassis complexity
* Increases the car's center of gravity (CG).

**Pull Rod:**

* Mounted from the lower part of the chassis to the upper wishbone
* Provides lower center of gravity.
* More complex, harder to access for assembly and maintenance

These systems are often combined and one is used in front and other is used in the rear. We only care about front though.

**Decision:** Push rod is much more feasible to implement and the CG impact is negligible.
