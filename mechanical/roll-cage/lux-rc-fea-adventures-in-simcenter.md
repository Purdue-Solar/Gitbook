# Lux RC FEA - Adventures in Simcenter

Importing files from elsewhere (fusion...) is not healthy for NX apparently. The modeler gets scared, the mesher gets confused, its a mess.&#x20;



MERGE FACE!!! Just saved my life. For some reason putting the step in was fine in modeling, then going to the fem there were all sorts of random edges that kept messing with the mesh and failing elements. The merge face tool in polygon geometry managed to fix it, idek what settings i used i tried like 3 times.
