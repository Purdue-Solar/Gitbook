Notes:&#x20;

* An APF is required for gas reimbursement. To reimburse an exact amount, upload a receipt as usual. You can reimburse up to 0.69 cents per mile for reimbursing a different amount. Attach a screenshot of the distance driven from Google Maps that lines up with the locations listed on the APF.
* When adding a note or replying to a note from BOSO, date and sign your messages to add context to the communication.&#x20;
