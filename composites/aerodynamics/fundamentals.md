# Fundamentals

Let's start with a review of aerodynamic fundamentals. The experienced (or uninterested) reader can skip this subpage.

To begin, <mark style="color:blue;">aerodynamics</mark> generally refers to the flow of air, although this term is pretty loosely defined. In our case, this flow is <mark style="color:blue;">external</mark> as the air travels over the exterior of the car. Air is considered a <mark style="color:blue;">fluid</mark>, a substance that deforms continously under an applied shear force. This is unlike solids, which resist applied shear forces by static deformation. Air is also generally considered a gas (duh — but liquid air technically does exist!), a fluid in which the molecules are widely spaced and share only brief interactions. Gases take the shape of their container, expanding to fill the entire volume.

Some important variables in aerodynamics include:

* Pressure (P) - normal force per unit area due to molecular motion
* Density (ρ) - mass per unit volume
* Temperature -&#x20;
* Viscosity
