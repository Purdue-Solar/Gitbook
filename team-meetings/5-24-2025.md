## To-Do List Items / FSGP Readiness

**Mechanical | Gus**

**Lower wishbone:**

* For anyone that didn't know, the LCAR wishbone snapped a while back. It has new been removed but we need new lowers. Kelly and I decided that we'll just replace the carbon tubes on all the lowers with aluminum tubes and depending on how things go we nay need the lowers from from one billet,

Tasks:

* Remove old carbon lower and clean parts (I will do before 5/23),
* Machine new lower tubes (I will do before 5/23),
* Glue and pin new tubes,
* Test in rough conditions,

**Steering Column**

* There's still a few things left to mill on the column shafts, and we'll need to print those angled blocks and cut a hole in the chassis. I'd also like to come up with a better way to do the steering stops.,

Tasks:

* Print angled blocks (evaluate after testing, maybe make aluminum),
* Mill keyways and match drill holes on the steering column,
* Cut a hole in the chassis ensuring proper alignment with the rack (still not sure the best way to do this),
* Install and test in rough conditions,
* Find a more elegant way of doing steering stops, implement and test,

**Brakes Stuff:**

* We need to get parts made for the new parking brake, and we need to fix the issue with the fittings coming loose on the MCs, whoever is here over the summer and is wants to learn CAM/machine that help would be appreciated,

Tasks:

* Machine all new components for parking brake,
* Remove old parking brake,
* Design and machine new bracket for the PB caliper,
* Find how much we need to space the brake pedla from the floor to stop fitting coming loose, machine plate and assemble,
* Machine new rear rotor: I'll talk with BIDC and see what the odds are that either the laser cutter or waterjet will be back up anytime soon, if not then we might be able to waterjet at CMSC, if not then we'll have to send it out,
* Come up with a better way to manage the brake lines near the suspension, adhesive pads are falling off with time and dirt/water from the wheels,
* Give the brakes a good bleeding, test brake decel, PB holding, rear brake holding,

**Interiors Stuff:**

* Only thing I can think of is the regen paddle, which I believe we are waiting for electrical to make the board? We'll also need a new display mount whenever the new display is finished. @\[Interiors] Jared Svetlev If you have a list of specific things that would be great.,

**Front Wheels:**

* Install spacer between the wheel nut and hub to force the cotter pins into shear,
* Maybe: drill the drive pin holes deeper and buy longer pins,
* Definitely: reglue the drive pins, clean up the pin holes on the hub,
* Test the rim that got reglues, this involves driving the car in rough conditions,
* Face off and clean up the rim hub that got damaged,

**Towing Hardpoint:**

* More of a composites thing, but the old towing hardpoint is out, Alfredo Pevin and are thinking we'll patch up the broken area, then put in a short and long horizontal solid carbon bar inside the chassis at the bottom, spanning the width of the chassis to serves as the new towing hardpoint.,

Tasks:

* Repair and clean up the front panel,
* Make and cut new solid carbon bar,
* Install and test
