# Augmented Reality

The goal of this is to create the car in either Unreal Engine or Unity to get a better idea of how the car will look/feel before it is built. This was done for lux briefly. A unity project was created from the .fbx exported from fusion which unity was able to import and apply materials to. The model is very basic and only offers visuals, adding in moving suspension, opening canopy and top shell, and lights would be a huge improvement.

For sizing purposes this solution works very well, but looks are not great. This would be a good way to show sponsors what we are building and could be sent along with the sponsorship packet if a good model was made. Most new phone offer AR and could have sponsors walk around and see the car and how their products could support us.

End goal for this would be to have a model that drives and could be hooked up to a steering wheel for dynamics testing. Rapid iteration of dynamics could be done to find how the car will perform under different configurations and weight distributions. This would greatly reduce the time to design a car.
