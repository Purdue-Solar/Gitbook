# Current Work

Strategy Projects (Updated):

&#x20;Clean Data, Make it presentable, plot things such as energy used, energy in, distance drove (Rohan)

Find efficiency of car, Find CDA and rolling resistance, fit Energy Estimator(Adi)

Energy estimator (Seth's python program) Done

Digital Twin, correct mass and dynamics Virtual Reality, Make interactive (Reed)&#x20;

Finish Telemetry board for Lux (Vineet)

Graphs of Energy Input and Performance (Mohit)



Estimate energy burned in brakes, What could have been saved with regenerative braking

Cooling of solar cells while driving, vs sitting. How hot do they get, do we need a better design?\
